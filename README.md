# How we made it
This website was created using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML, we have 13 functions and two Classes. We have used arrow functions and normal functions. A cool thing we did was making the navbar and footer with custom elements, by defining two classes. You can read more about it here:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components

# Why we made it?
We are 6 guys currently studying Computer Science at NTNU in Norway. This was a project during a course called IT2805, at NTNU. We were supposed to make a website for a real or fictive company. We chose a fictive company called Kaba-kada, which is a rainforest conservation company. We made this website to show our skills in web development, and to show what we have learned in the course.
